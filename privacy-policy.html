                <ul>
                    <li>My website is hosted on Vercel. Vercel Analytics is used by default and is designed to be privacy-respecting, providing insights into website traffic without using cookies or collecting detailed personal identifiers from visitors. It may collect aggregated and anonymized data about website visits.</li>
                    <li>If you interact with embedded third-party tools (like Calendly or forms from my email marketing provider), these services may collect technical information as per their own privacy policies.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>I use the personal data I collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To respond to your inquiries:</strong> When you contact me via the contact form or email (Lawful basis: Legitimate interest to respond to your query; or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract).</li>
            <li><strong>To provide you with requested resources:</strong> To deliver lead magnets you have signed up for (Lawful basis: Consent, or performance of a contract if the resource is part of an agreed service).</li>
            <li><strong>To send you my newsletter and marketing communications (where you have consented):</strong> To provide you with insights, articles, podcast updates, and information about my services (Lawful basis: Explicit Consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email or by contacting me.</li>
            <li><strong>To manage scheduled calls:</strong> To facilitate discovery calls or other booked sessions via Calendly (Lawful basis: To take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, or performance of a contract).</li>

            <li><strong>To comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Our Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
        <p>I will only process your personal data where I have a lawful basis to do so. The lawful bases I rely on are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where you have explicitly agreed to me processing your personal data for a specific purpose (e.g., signing up for a newsletter or a lead magnet where ongoing marketing is also offered with separate consent).</li>
            <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or to take steps at your request before entering into a contract (e.g., responding to a service inquiry, fulfilling a booked consultation).</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Where processing is necessary for my legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests. This includes responding to your general inquiries, operating and improving my website, and for business administration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>I value your privacy and will not sell your personal data to third parties. However, I may share your data with trusted third-party service providers who act as "data processors" on my behalf to help me operate my business and Website. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Hosting:</strong> Vercel (for hosting didianolue.co.uk).</li>
            <li><strong>Email Marketing Platform:</strong> <strong>[Name of Email Marketing Platform, e.g., MailerLite or ConvertKit]</strong> (for managing email lists, delivering lead magnets, and sending newsletters).</li>
            <li><strong>Form Processing:</strong> <strong>[If using a separate service like Formspree, name it here, or state it's handled by your Email Marketing Platform, e.g., "Handled by Mailerlite"</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduling Tool:</strong> Calendly (for booking calls).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> Vercel Analytics (default, privacy-focused). <strong>Mailerlite</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will only share data that is necessary for them to provide their services and I have agreements in place (such as Data Processing Agreements) to ensure they process your data securely and in accordance with UK GDPR. Some of these providers may be based outside the UK. Where data is transferred internationally, I ensure appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses with the UK Addendum, or adequacy decisions).</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>I will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes I collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data from contact form inquiries will be kept for as long as necessary to deal with the inquiry and for a reasonable period thereafter for record-keeping <strong> 5 years</strong>.</li>
            <li>Data collected for lead magnet delivery and newsletter subscriptions will be kept as long as you remain subscribed or until I no longer offer the service. If you unsubscribe, I will take steps to delete or anonymise your data within a reasonable timeframe, unless I need to keep it for legal reasons.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>I take the security of your personal data seriously and have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it against accidental loss, unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. This includes using secure services for data processing and limiting access to your data. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>Under UK GDPR, you have several rights regarding your personal data:</p>

        <h2>9. Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. My Website hosted on Vercel uses Vercel Analytics, which is designed to be privacy-respecting and does not use cookies to track individual users by default. However, some embedded third-party services, such as forms from my email marketing provider (<strong>[Name of Email Marketing Platform]</strong>) or my scheduling tool (Calendly), may set their own cookies to function correctly or for their own analytics or preference purposes. For more detailed information about any cookies that may be used by these third-party services, please refer to their respective cookie and privacy policies. <strong>[Optional but recommended: "You can usually manage cookie preferences through your browser settings. For more information on how we might use cookies, please see our [Link to a separate Cookie Policy if you create one]."]</strong></p>

        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Some of my third-party service providers (such as <strong>Mailerlite</strong>, Calendly, Vercel) may be based outside the UK, particularly in the USA. When your personal data is transferred to these countries, I ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data, such as relying on the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, adequacy decisions made by the UK government, or implementing Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the UK Addendum.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
